Added Box Collider Component. It is showing in the game if visible is set to true. 
No collision testing is added for it yet, however

-------------------------------
Starting using a Component/Entity-based System. So far, it is working.

The System class is a static class that updates the C/ES system. 

The player is responding to left and right key inputs and events. Now I just need 
to figure out how to make a scenenode graph, dividing the game objects into layers, how 
to implement a state stack, and how to create different scenes, loading objects when the
game goes to a different scene.

Further improvements to the tile engine - it appears all movements and collisions work!

Also got the falling and jumping states to respond correctly to collision with tiles above and below the player
with the checkTileAbovePlayer and checkTileBelowPlayer functions
